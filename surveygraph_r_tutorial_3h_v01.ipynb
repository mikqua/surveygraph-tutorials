    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will work through a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format allows us to combine sequences of text chunks (explanations) and code chunks (demonstrations). Once you have run all the code chunks, you have something like a markdown document which contains all the text, syntax and output in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Jupyter notebooks on your own computer  (see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)), but for convenience -- and internet allowing -- we will run them in Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a notebook open in Colab, it will have free cloud computing resources attached called a **kernel**, providing a small CPU, some disk space and memory. You can usually specify which language to use (R, Python etc). These resources are usually volatile -- they resources are assigned temporarily and the workspace will reset if you are away for a while.\n",
    "**If this happens, you will have to re-run key code chunks (like loading libraries) before continuing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunk you are reading now is a **markdown chunk**. If you double click it you can see the source. There are some codes for headings, bold etc. that render on display.\n",

    "**Code chunks** can be run by clicking the \"play\" arrow; they look like this (an image for demonstration only):\n",

(And, for this reason, it is important to use meaningful and descriptive names for objects).\n",

    "\n",
    "`ls()` will list all of the objects in the working environment. Don't worry if there are objects you don't recognize: sometimes there are a few automatically generated ones, depending on the platform you are using. Of course, one of the advantages of scripting is that the names of the objects are also available in the script you have written, so more importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the structure of an object?\n",
    "`str(object_name)` will summarize the structure of the object. e.g. Is it a character or integer? A vector or an array? This is especially useful for checking the structure of objects returned from functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thresholding is a very important part of the procedure, as it is the only *researcher degree of freedom* in the method, apart from variable selection, but without it the graphs are not much use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem with fully connected graphs\n",
    "If we take a projection of a survey and include all edges, it will be fully connected; i.e. every node will be connected to every other node. The edges will have different weights, with some stronger and some weaker, but it is still very difficult to make sense of such a system.  As we saw above, without sparsifying the network, there is little chance of identifying any meaningful structure, even if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could potentially be dealt with by generating the fully connected network and then applying some other method, e.g. backbone detection, but you would need to be sure that it makes sense to do so (ie. that the logic of the sparsification algorithm maps well onto the theoretical framework of attitude networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can identify an appropriate  threshold while we generate the projection. This has very substantial efficiency gains when dealing with large samples, since the size of the fully-connected edgelist will be exponentially larger than the sample size. For this reason, it makes sense to use at least light thresholding as soon as the sample size exceeds 1,000. (By the time the sample is 10,000 the agent-layer edgelist for a fully connected graph will already be 50 *million* rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thresholding methods implemented in surveygraph\n",
    "Our aim is to remove as many edges as possible without compromising our ability to detect group structure. Surveygraph currently implements three methods: `target_lcc`, `target_ad`, and `raw_similarity`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: `target_lcc` -- Target the size of the Largest Connected Component\n",
    "A **component** is a set of nodes that are all connecetd. In other words, every pair of nodes in a component has a path of edges between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Largest Connected Component (LCC)** of a network is, somewhat obviously, the largest component in the network. In even moderately dense networks, this usually includes almost all of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal threshold, the `target_lcc` thresholding method exploits a very well established feature of graphs: that we can usually remove a lot of edges before losing any (or many) nodes from the LCC. And there is usually a very sharp transition, where the LCC will disintegrate rapidly once we reach a specific threshold. The precise value of that threshold differs from network to network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you can remove a lot of edges before there is any appreciable effect on the largest component; but once that transition point is breached the LCC disintegrates rapidly. For a detailed background on the properties of component sizes, se _Networks_ by Mark Newman (Oxford University Press, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is excellent theoretical fit here: by using the coherence of the LCC as a guide for setting a sparsification threshold, we are identifying the optimal values for identifying a coherent group structure in the data. This assumes, (a) that one exists, and (b) that it makes sense that the whole sample will cohere (roughly) in a single group. In some contexts it might make sense to expect that multiple group structures will exist without \"joining,\" in which case setting a threshold with more fragmentation would make sense.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For reasonably-sized samples in relatively cohesive settings, however, `target_lcc` makes a lot of sense: we drop as many low-strength edges as we can whilst keeping the Largest Connected Component intact. In other words, the edges dropped are the weakest edges; and those not required for maintaining a cohesive (single) group structure.  Specifically, we rank the edges by weight, and keep removing the weakest ones until the proportion of nodes in the LCC reaches the target specified in the `method_value` parameter.\n",

    "A very basic questionnaire simulation function, primarily useful for simulating data with group-based polairzation. Returns a data frame of simulated data, with the first column (named `group`) being a grouping variable and the remaining columns (named `item_1, item_2, .. , item_N`) being data simulated to resemble answers to Likert-type items (item response range 1:10).\n",

    "Blau proposed a very similar model of homophilic association for socio-demographic characteristics. This became quite influential in structural sociology but was not, to our knowledge, extended to model attitudes. This paper is particularly useful, however, to justify using surveygraph to model other kinds of associative networks.  \n",

    "While this work does not consider attitudes, it makes a clear argument for the bipartite metaphor in understanding the reciprocal, co-constitutive, relationship between individuals and groups. In other words, it establishes a basis for the bipartite structure as a means for capturing what is usually referred to in the social identity approach as \"interactionism.\"\n",

However, we have been directly testing our core claim that jointly held attitudes can, themselves, be the basis for identification and perception of affinity:\n",

    "We strip away the socio-structural context by using novel attitudes to determine whether attitude congruence alone can be a category cue which can foster identification and whether such group identification mediates the relationship between attitude exposure and attitude polarisation. We find that rven novel attitudes can be self-categorisation cues informing identification and influencing attitude polarisation. Beyond reflecting connection with pre-existing identities, identification can be *based on* shared attitudes; this is potentially important for understanding opinion dynamics online. Attitude congruence fosters stronger identification than non-attitude congruence or minimal groupness (e.g. based on group names or colours).\n",
