Learning resources for the surveygraph R and python packages

Navigate to 

* __presentations__ to see how GitHub displays a dummy presentation 
* __gallery__ to see network visualisations of survey data 
* __scripts__ for jupyter notebooks and R scripts
* __feedback__ for a google survey to give us feedback on the package

_Note that none of this material exists yet, this is simply a mockup README file._

### Setting up an environment

We prefer jupyter notebooks for these tutorials. To install an R kernel,

```
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()  # to register the kernel in the current R installation
```

We then run

```
jupyter labextension install @techrah/text-shortcuts  # for RStudioâ€™s shortcuts
```

This requires Jupyter, as well as R, to be installed. For more information see https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel.
